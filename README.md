# What does saulgoodman.exe do?
When you launch the program a Saul Goodman gif will appear that will jump through entire screen while Better Call Saul Main Theme plays in the background.

# Is it safe?
Yes, it's safe. It's just a tool that you can use to prank someone. It does not send any data anywhere!

# How do I stop it?
You just need to press the 'end' key on your keyboard or restart your computer (there is no autostart feature so safemod is not neccessary).

# I can't open task manager
Program automatically kills cmd, task manager, process hacker and system monitor so it is harder to close it.
